# React + TypeScript + react-hook-form + Yup

This application shows client-side form validation in action. The application is written in TypeScript using React framework as well as react-hook-form for forms management and Yup for form validation. Inspired by the Live Demo on the main page of [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
